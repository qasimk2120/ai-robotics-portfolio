      "Basic vanilla cake (from-scratch)\n",
      "Ingredients:\n",
      "- 1 1/2 cups (190 g) all-purpose flour\n",
      "- 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons baking powder\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 1/2 cup (115 g) unsalted butter, softened\n",
      "- 2 large eggs\n",
      "- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n",
      "- 1/2 cup (120 ml) milk (any kind)\n",
      "\n",
      "Optional: for extra richness, replace part of milk with sour cream or yogurt (about 2–3 tablespoons).\n",
      "\n",
      "Equipment:\n",
      "- Two 8-inch (20 cm) round cake pans or one 9x13 inch pan\n",
      "- Mixing bowls, whisk or mixer, spatula\n",
      "- Parchment paper (optional)\n",
      "\n",
      "Steps:\n",
      "1) Preheat and prepare pans: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease pans and line bottoms with parchment for easy release.\n",
      "2) Dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n",
      "3) Cream butter and sugar: In a large bowl, beat butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 2–3 minutes.\n",
      "4) Add eggs and vanilla: Beat in eggs one at a time, then mix in vanilla.\n",
      "5) Combine: Alternate adding dry ingredients and milk to the batter, starting and ending with dry ingredients. Mix until just combined; don’t overmix.\n",
      "6) Bake: Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake 24–28 minutes for 8-inch pans, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If using a 9x13 pan, bake about 30–35 minutes.\n",
      "7) Cool: Let cakes cool in pans 5–10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely before frosting.\n",

      "Simple buttercream frosting (quick)\n",
      "- 1/2 cup (115 g) unsalted butter, softened\n",
      "- 1 1/2–2 cups (180–240 g) powdered sugar\n",
      "- 1–2 tablespoons milk or cream\n",
      "- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\n",
      "\n",
      "Beat butter until smooth. Gradually add powdered sugar, then enough milk to reach spreading consistency. Mix in vanilla. Adjust with more sugar or milk as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Filling and decorating ideas:\n",
      "- Spread a layer of jam, lemon curd, or chocolate ganache between layers.\n",
      "- Dust with powdered sugar, or frost with buttercream and decorate with sprinkles, fruit, or edible flowers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips:\n",
      "- Room-temperature ingredients mix more evenly.\n",
      "- Don’t overmix after adding dry ingredients to keep the cake tender.\n",
      "- If you only have one 8-inch pan, bake in two batches or bake as a sheet cake (adjust bake time to 30–40 minutes in a 9x13 pan).\n",
      "- For a chocolate version, add 1/3 cup (28 g) unsweetened cocoa powder and a touch more milk.\n",
